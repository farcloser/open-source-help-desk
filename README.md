# Open-source projects help-desk

While contributing to open-source projects is one of the great pleasures and
most rewarding experiences for software engineers, it usually comes with 
hurdles, constraints, and unfamiliar rituals, that may feel intimidating, 
hard to overcome, or even outright prevent newcomers from getting their work 
accepted.

We believe these hurdles are mundane, and can be eased out or even vanquished with
the appropriate, simple documentation that would apply to almost all open-source projects - 
and in doing so, we hope to lower the barrier of entry to contributing, hopefully
enticing and empowering more developers to engage.


## Current documentation

* [Git cheat sheet for contributors](GIT.md)
  * everything you always wanted to know about the DCO, squashing, rebasing, signing, 
rewriting old commits and other git athletics
